# Hand Gesture Recognition Using Mediapipe & ANN

This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture recognition using **Mediapipe** for hand tracking and an **Artificial Neural Network (ANN)** for gesture classification. It enables computers to understand and respond to hand gestures, opening up possibilities for controlling devices, navigating interfaces, or enhancing gaming experiences.

## How It Works

1. **Hand Tracking with Mediapipe**:  
   Mediapipe tracks hand movements and extracts key landmark positions from the hand. These positions represent the relative angles and distances between different points on the hand.

2. **Feature Extraction**:  
   The extracted landmark positions are converted into numerical features, making it easier for the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to recognize patterns in the data.

3. **Gesture Classification**:  
   The trained ANN model classifies gestures based on the input features. The system can recognize gestures such as:
   - **Up**
   - **Down**
   - **Left**
   - **Right**
   - **Forward**
   - **Backward**
   - **Flip**
   - **Land**

4. **Real-Time Response**:  
   The system runs on a live video feed, so as you move your hand, the model immediately recognizes the gesture and triggers a corresponding action in real time.

## Why This Matters

Hand gesture recognition is a significant step towards **touchless interaction**. This can be applied to:
- **Device control** (e.g., drones, smart devices)
- **Accessibility improvements** for individuals with disabilities
- **Enhanced gaming experiences** or **virtual interfaces** like AR/VR

This project lays the foundation for intuitive, gesture-based interfaces that feel natural and are easy to use.

## Tech Behind the Scenes

- **Languages & Libraries**: Python  
- **Key Libraries**:  
  - OpenCV for video processing  
  - Mediapipe for real-time hand tracking  
  - TensorFlow/Keras for building and training the ANN

- **Custom Dataset**:  
  A custom dataset of hand gestures was used to train the model, ensuring it can recognize a variety of common gestures.

## Where This Could Go

This project is just the beginning! There are endless possibilities for its evolution:
- **Gesture-controlled drones**: Navigate a drone using hand gestures.
- **Smart home automation**: Control lights, TVs, and more with gestures.
- **Sign language translation**: Bridge communication gaps by translating hand gestures into text or speech.
- **AR/VR interfaces**: Enhance virtual environments with natural hand movements.

The potential is limitless, and weâ€™re just scratching the surface!
